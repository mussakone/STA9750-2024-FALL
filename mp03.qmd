# Introduction

# 

This project explores how the outcomes of U.S. presidential elections might have changed under different electoral allocation rules, using historical congressional election data. While this type of retrospective analysis, or "retrodiction," has inherent limitations, it offers a unique way to examine potential biases in the electoral college system.It's important to note that if these rules had actually been in place, candidates may have campaigned differently, which could have affected vote counts.

For this analysis,I will examine a claim by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has stated that the Electoral College "disadvantages voters in heavily populated states" and results in an "undemocratic" election outcome. The final goal of this analysis is to create a "Fact Check" style report. This project will analyze the results of presidential elections under different allocation methods to evaluate the existence of such bias, summarize findings based on this analysis, and provide a "truthfulness" score for Senator Warren's claim, using the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter scale: "True" "Mostly True," "Half True," "Mostly False," or "False."

First, the necessary data from the The MIT Election Data Science Lab that collects votes from all biennial congressional races in all 50 states will be downloaded, as well as the statewide presidential vote counts from 1976 to 2022.

## Task 1: Download Congressional Shapefiles 1976-2012

In this task, we aim to automate the process of downloading U.S. congressional district shapefiles for each Congress from 1976 to 2012. These shapefiles, provided by Lewis et al., allow us to visualize and analyze geographic boundaries that define congressional districts over time.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to Show/Hide Code"

# Load required libraries
library(httr)    # For HTTP requests
library(glue)    # For formatted strings
library(fs)      # For file and directory handling

# Set up directory for shapefiles
download_dir <- "data/shapefiles"
if (!dir_exists(download_dir)) dir_create(download_dir)

# Define base URL and range of Congress sessions
base_url <- "https://cdmaps.polisci.ucla.edu/shp/districts"
congress_years <- seq(94, 112)  # Congresses from 1976 to 2012 (94th to 112th)

# Loop through Congress sessions to download shapefiles
for (congress in congress_years) {
  # Define file name and path
  zip_file_name <- glue("c{congress}_dist.zip")
  zip_file_path <- path(download_dir, zip_file_name)
  
  # Download only if the file does not already exist
  if (!file_exists(zip_file_path)) {
    # Construct the download URL
    download_url <- glue("{base_url}/{zip_file_name}")
    
    # Try downloading the file
    cat("Attempting to download:", download_url, "\n")
    response <- tryCatch({
      GET(download_url, write_disk(zip_file_path, overwrite = TRUE))
    }, error = function(e) {
      cat("Error downloading:", zip_file_name, "\n")
      NULL
    })
    
    # Check if the download was successful
    if (!is.null(response) && status_code(response) == 200) {
      cat("Downloaded:", zip_file_name, "\n")
      
      # Extract .shp files from the zip file if download successful
      extracted_dir <- path(download_dir, glue("congress_{congress}"))
      if (!dir_exists(extracted_dir)) dir_create(extracted_dir)
      
      # Unzip only the .shp files
      shp_files <- grep("\\.shp$", unzip(zip_file_path, list = TRUE)$Name, value = TRUE)
      unzip(zip_file_path, files = shp_files, exdir = extracted_dir)
      cat("Extracted shapefiles for Congress", congress, "\n")
    }
  } else {
    cat("File already exists:", zip_file_name, "- Skipping download.\n")
  }
}

cat("All shapefiles processed successfully.\n")
```

## Task 2: Automated Download of Congressional Shapefiles (2014-2022)

In this task, we aim to automate the process of downloading congressional district shapefiles for each U.S. Congress from 2014 to 2022. These shapefiles, available from the U.S. Census Bureau, provide geographical boundary data for congressional districts, which is crucial for spatial analysis and mapping of political and demographic trends. Additionally, we will extract only the necessary `.shp` files from each downloaded zip archive, organizing them with a clear naming convention for easy reference in future analysis. This structured approach will facilitate accurate and reproducible results for any subsequent spatial analyses or visualizations involving U.S. congressional districts.

if (!dir_exists(download_dir)) dir_create(download_dir)

# Define the years corresponding to each Congress session (2014-2022)

# Function to download and extract shapefiles for each year
for (year in years) {
  year_url <- glue(base_url, year = year)
  
  # Get list of zip files available for each year
  page <- tryCatch({
    read_html(year_url)
  }, error = function(e) {
    cat("Could not access:", year_url, "\n")
    return(NULL)
  })
  
  # If the page was successfully accessed, proceed
  if (!is.null(page)) {
    # Get links to all zip files in the directory
    zip_files <- page %>% html_nodes("a") %>% html_attr("href") %>%

      file_path <- path(download_dir, file_name)
      file_url <- paste0(year_url, zip_file)

      } else {

      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Task 3: Exploration Of Vote Count Data

This task will require to go back to data we intially downloaded at the start of this report to answer several questions regarding the House of Representatives, the fusion system, and presidential candidate trends in different states.

## 1. Which states have gained and lost the most seats in the US House of Representatives between 1976 and 2022?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Click to Show/Hide Code"

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(knitr)

# Load the data
  house_data <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "1976-2022-house.csv"))

# Count unique districts per state and year
district_counts <- house_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(district)) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(num_districts = n_distinct(district), .groups = 'drop')

# Get counts for 1976 and 2022
district_counts_1976 <- district_counts %>% filter(year == 1976) %>% select(state, num_districts)
district_counts_2022 <- district_counts %>% filter(year == 2022) %>% select(state, num_districts)

# Calculate change in seats from 1976 to 2022
seat_changes <- district_counts_2022 %>%
  rename(num_districts_2022 = num_districts) %>%
  inner_join(district_counts_1976, by = "state", suffix = c("_2022", "_1976")) %>%
  mutate(seat_change = num_districts_2022 - num_districts) %>%
  arrange(desc(seat_change))

# Top 5 states with most gain and most loss in seats

```

## 2 New York State has a unique “fusion” voting system where one candidate can appear on multiple “lines” on the ballot and their vote counts are totaled. For instance, in 2022, Jerrold Nadler appeared on both the Democrat and Working Families party lines for NYS’ 12th Congressional District. He received 200,890 votes total (184,872 as a Democrat and 16,018 as WFP), easily defeating Michael Zumbluskas, who received 44,173 votes across three party lines (Republican, Conservative, and Parent).Are there any elections in our data where the election would have had a different outcome if the “fusion” system was not used and candidates only received the votes their received from their “major party line” (Democrat or Republican) and not their total number of votes across all lines?

house_data <- house_data %>%
  mutate(is_major_party = ifelse(party %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN"), TRUE, FALSE))

# Aggregate votes by candidate across all lines and calculate total and major-only votes
total_votes_by_candidate <- house_data %>%
  group_by(year, state, district, candidate, party) %>%
  summarize(total_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE),
            major_party_votes = sum(candidatevotes[is_major_party], na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = 'drop')

# Check if aggregation resulted in any data
if (nrow(total_votes_by_candidate) == 0) {
  stop("No aggregated vote data available for the specified candidates.")
}

# Identify potential outcome changes across all states
outcome_changes <- total_votes_by_candidate %>%
  group_by(year, state, district) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_votes)) %>%
  mutate(winner_total = candidate[which.max(total_votes)],
         winner_major_only = candidate[which.max(major_party_votes)],
         outcome_change = winner_total != winner_major_only) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, state, district, candidate, party, total_votes, major_party_votes, winner_total, winner_major_only, outcome_change)

# Display the result as a table with all necessary details
kable(outcome_changes, caption = "Comparison of Presidential and Congressional Votes by State, Year, and Party (including outcome changes)")

```

##3 Do presidential candidates tend to run ahead of or run behind congressional candidates in the same state? That is, does a Democratic candidate for president tend to get more votes in a given state than all Democratic congressional candidates in the same state?

Does this trend differ over time? Does it differ across states or across parties? Are any presidents particularly more or less popular than their co-partisans?

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load the data files - update paths if needed
house_data <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "1976-2022-house.csv"))
president_data <- read_csv(file.path(data_dir, "1976-2020-president.csv"))

# Create a new `party_detailed` column in `house_data` based on `party`
house_data <- house_data %>%
  mutate(party_detailed = party)  # Copy `party` values to a new `party_detailed` column

# Aggregate votes by year, state, and party_detailed for congressional data
house_data <- house_data %>%

  summarize(total_congress_votes = sum(candidatevotes, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

# Aggregate votes by year, state, and party_detailed for presidential data

```

## Task 4: Automate Zip File Extraction In this task, we are creating a reusable function, read_shp_from_zip(), to efficiently handle shapefile data stored within zip archives above . Rather than manually unzipping files and locating shapefiles, this function automates the process by locating, extracting and seamlessly loading.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)

if(!file.exists("nyc_borough_boundaries.zip")){
    download.file("https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/geospatial/tqmj-j8zm?method=export&format=Shapefile", 
              destfile="nyc_borough_boundaries.zip")
}

##-

# Define the function to read a shapefile directly from a zip archive
read_shp_from_zip <- function(zip_file) {
  # Create a temporary directory for unzipping
  td <- tempdir()
  
  # List contents of the zip file and find the .shp file
  zip_contents <- unzip(zip_file, list = TRUE)
  shp_file <- zip_contents$Name[grepl("shp$", zip_contents$Name)]
  
  # Unzip only the .shp file into the temporary directory
  unzip(zip_file, files = shp_file, exdir = td, overwrite = TRUE)
  
  # Construct path to the .shp file
  shp_path <- file.path(td, shp_file)
  
  # Read the .shp file using read_sf from the sf package
  sf_object <- read_sf(shp_path)
  
  return(sf_object)
}

# Use the function to read the shapefile from the zip archive
nyc_sf <- read_shp_from_zip("nyc_borough_boundaries.zip")
print(nyc_sf)
```

```{r}
ggplot(nyc_sf, 
       aes(geometry=geometry)) + 
    geom_sf()
```

## Task7 Comparing the Effects of ECV Allocation Rules

After analyzing historical voting data,I believe that the State-Wide Winner Take All method that we all currently use in the country actually gives a slight edge to Republican candidates.It generally favors candidates who can win swing states and is the least aligned with the popular vote, and Republicans have been winning.The National Proportional system is likely the fairest in terms of reflecting the popular vote directly. ##Task 7 Evaluating Fairness of ECV Allocation Schemes Based on our analysis, it is shown that the National Proportional System is the fairest allocation method for the Electoral College, aligning most closely with Senator Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the current system disadvantages voters in heavily populated states. Under the existing State-Wide Winner-Take-All system, the Electoral College disproportionately boosts the voices of voters in smaller states. This is because smaller states receive a minimum of three electoral votes regardless of population, giving each individual vote more weight compared to votes in heavily populated states. As a result, candidates can lose the national popular vote but still win the presidency, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 elections, where the winners (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) did not win the popular vote but won the electoral vote.

On the contrary, the National Proportional System allocates Electoral College Votes (ECVs) based directly on each candidate’s share of the national popular vote. This makes sure that ECV distribution reflects the actual voter preference nationwide. This system would prevent outcomes where the Electoral College diverges from the popular vote, promoting a fairer representation of voter intentions. For example, in the 2020 election, a proportional allocation would have still resulted in Joe Biden's victory, based off his popular vote lead, while eliminating excess influence from swing states.

Based on the analysis, we rate Senator Warren’s claim as "Mostly True" on the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter. The current system indeed disadvantages voters in larger, heavily populated states by concentrating influence in smaller or swing states. A National Proportional System would mitigate this issue by providing a more democratic and representative outcome, which closely goes along with Senator Warren’s perspective.
